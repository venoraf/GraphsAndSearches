PROJECT NAME 

  Weighted Directed Graph Representation

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

  My program takes two file names as its command-line input. The first file includes the weighted directed graph. The second file includes queries on the constructed graph. Each line contains a separate query that
  starts with the query type and a vertex, separated by a space. My program reads the contents of this file and constructs the weighted graph data structure. Upon processing an adjacency query, my program also prints
  out the vertices adjacent to the queried vertex, sorted lexicographically.
