PROGRAM NAME 

  Undirected Graph Representation

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

  This program takes two file names as its command-line input. The first file includes the undirected graph. The second file includes queries on the constructed graph. 
  Each line contains a separate query that starts with the query type and a vertex, separated by a space. My  program reads the contents of this file and constructs the undirected graph data structure.
